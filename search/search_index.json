It provides a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage both customers and their associated training sessions. Overview: The API is structured around two main resources: Customers and Trainings . Customers represent the individuals who are receiving personal training. Each customer has attributes such as name and contact information. Trainings represent the individual training sessions that a customer has with their personal trainer. Each training session has attributes such as date, time, duration, and the specific exercises performed. There is a one-to-many relationship between customers and trainings, meaning that each customer can have multiple associated training sessions, but each training session is associated with only one customer. Base URL https://customerrestservice-personaltraining.rahtiapp.fi/api Reset Database To reset database you can use the following request that deletes all data from the database and re-populate it with the original demo data. POST https://customerrestservice-personaltraining.rahtiapp.fi/reset Response: Upon successful reset, the API will return a 200 OK status code and the response body contains text: DB reset done . If the reset operation fails for any reason, the API will return an appropriate error status code and message.","title":"General"},{"location":"#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"#personal-trainer-rest-api-documentation","text":"This REST API is designed to manage the relationship between personal trainers and their customers.
